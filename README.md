Welcome to Dungeon Run
Dungeon is a game in which you are placed on a map and you goal is to collect the treasures which are hidden in rooms. However, in these rooms you may also find monsters which you will have to defeat in order to collect the treasure in said room.

## First steps

When you first start the application, you are faced with four (4) options.
In said options, you will be faced with:

1. Start your adventure

Here you will get the option to create a new character and choose the class that you want to use

2. Start adventure with existing character

Here you will get the option to use an already existing character and keep collecting treasures with said character.

3. See stats of previous adventures

Here you will get the option to show statistics of the previous adventures that have been played.

4. Exit game

Pretty self explanatory, but you get the option to exit game.

## To run the game

From scratch, you can simply click the the arrow symbol in the top right corner, then see steps 1-4 in "First steps"
