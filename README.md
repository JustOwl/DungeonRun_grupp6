Welcome to Dungeon Run
Dungeon is a game in which you are placed on a map and you goal is to collect the treasures which are hidden in rooms. However, in these rooms you may also find monsters which you will have to defeat in order to collect the treasure in said room.

## First steps

When you first start the application, you are faced with four (4) options.
In said options, you will be faced with:

    1.c. Select starting position (Top left, righ or bottom left, right).
    1.d. Select the size of the map you want to play on.

2. Start adventure with existing character
